# Challenge 1

## Description

In this project, I was given the HTML and CSS code for an online marketing page, and I was asked to make some changes for the client.

My motivation was to fully satisfy the client's  requests. This project includes all the changes the client asked for, and as a result, I improved my HTML and CSS skills.
